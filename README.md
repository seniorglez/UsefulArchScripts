# Useful Arch Scripts

Just some bash scripts I use on my arch installation.

## Set up

First and foremost clone the repo.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/seniorglez/UsefulArchScripts.git

```

Now you should change the permisions of the files to add the execute permision. For your own user:

```bash

chmod +x UsefulArchScripts/*.sh

```
